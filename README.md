# Automated Football Data Analysis Pipeline with R

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project showcases a complete, automated pipeline for football data analysis built entirely in **R**. The system is designed to perform daily web scraping of player and team statistics from FBRef, process the data, and generate updated reports automatically. It demonstrates an end-to-end solution for maintaining fresh, reliable data insights with minimal manual intervention.

The core of the project is a set of R scripts that handle data extraction, cleaning, analysis, and automated report generation, simulating a real-world data engineering workflow for a sports analytics department.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Technologies

The pipeline is composed of several key components:

1.  **Automated Data Scraping**:
    *   **Technology**: `rvest`
    *   **Functionality**: Extracts comprehensive football data from FBRef, including overall team stats, standard player stats, shooting, passing, and possession metrics. Custom scraping functions (`scrape_overall_data()`, `scrape_squad_shooting()`, etc.) are tailored for specific data tables.

2.  **Scheduled Execution**:
    *   **Technology**: `taskscheduleR`
    *   **Functionality**: Automates the execution of the entire pipeline by scheduling the R script to run daily. This ensures that the data is always up-to-date without any manual trigger.

3.  **Data Processing and Cleaning**:
    *   **Technology**: `dplyr`, `tidyr`
    *   **Functionality**: Once extracted, the raw data is cleaned and processed to ensure quality and consistency. A `clean_data()` function handles column normalization, imputation of missing values, and data type correction, making the dataset ready for analysis.

4.  **Data Analysis and Visualization**:
    *   **Technology**: `ggplot2`
    *   **Functionality**: The clean dataset is used to generate statistical summaries and visualizations. The script explores key metrics such as goals per team, possession stats, and performance indicators, saving the results as organized CSV files for future analysis.

5.  **Automated HTML Reporting**:
    *   **Technology**: `rmarkdown`
    *   **Functionality**: The final results are presented in a clear and dynamic HTML report. A `generate_report()` function integrates tables and charts into a professional-looking document, which is automatically generated after each pipeline run.

## üîß Technical and Ethical Scraping Strategies

This project also addresses common challenges in web scraping:

*   **Execution Time Optimization**: Implements strategies to handle large data volumes efficiently. The modular design allows for potential parallelization using packages like `parallel` or `foreach`.
*   **Web Blocking Avoidance**: The code structure is mindful of scraping etiquette to avoid overwhelming the target server. In a production environment, this could be enhanced with proxy rotation and randomized request intervals.
*   **Dynamic Page Handling**: Includes robust selectors to handle potential changes in website structure. Error handling and logging are key components for maintaining long-term script functionality.
*   **Ethical Considerations**: The scraping process is designed to be respectful of the website's `robots.txt` and Terms of Service. Ethical data collection is a core principle of this project.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Potential Enhancements: Database and Cloud Integration

To further improve data management and scalability, this pipeline could be integrated with:

1.  **Relational Databases (e.g., SQLite)**: Using `RSQLite` to store the scraped data locally in a lightweight SQL database. This would enable more complex queries and better data organization.
2.  **Cloud Services (e.g., Google BigQuery)**: Leveraging the `bigrquery` package to upload and manage large volumes of data in the cloud. This approach ensures data is always accessible, scalable, and ready for advanced analytics from any location.

## üöÄ How to Use

1.  **Setup Environment**: Make sure you have R and RStudio installed.
2.  **Install Dependencies**: Run `install.packages()` for all the required libraries (`rvest`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `ggplot2`, `taskscheduleR`, `rmarkdown`).
3.  **Configure Scheduler (Optional)**: Use the `taskscheduleR` functions to set up a daily automated task on your machine.
4.  **Run Manually**: Execute the main R script (`your_main_script.R`) to run the entire pipeline once and generate the initial report.
